	abstract = {Determining the cancer type and molecular subtype has important clinical implications. The primary site is however unknown for some malignancies discovered in the metastatic stage. Moreover liquid biopsies may be used to screen for tumoral DNA, which upon detection needs to be assigned to a site-of-origin. Classifiers based on genomic features are a promising approach to prioritize the tumor anatomical site, type and subtype. We examined the predictive ability of causal (driver) somatic mutations in this task, comparing it against global patterns of non-selected (passenger) mutations, including features based on regional mutation density (RMD). In the task of distinguishing 18 cancer types, the driver mutations–mutated oncogenes or tumor suppressors, pathways and hotspots–classified 36\% of the patients to the correct cancer type. In contrast, the features based on passenger mutations did so at 92\% accuracy, with similar contribution from the RMD and the trinucleotide mutation spectra. The RMD and the spectra covered distinct sets of patients with predictions. In particular, introducing the RMD features into a combined classification model increased the fraction of diagnosed patients by 50 percentage points (at 20\% FDR). Furthermore, RMD was able to discriminate molecular subtypes and/or anatomical site of six major cancers. The advantage of passenger mutations was upheld under high rates of false negative mutation calls and with exome sequencing, even though overall accuracy decreased. We suggest whole genome sequencing is valuable for classifying tumors because it captures global patterns emanating from mutational processes, which are informative of the underlying tumor biology.},

@article{Flores-Bello:2018aa,
	Abstract = {Basques show specific cultural, demographic, and genetic characteristics that have placed them as an isolated and unique population within Europe, such as their non-Indo-European language, Euskara. They have historically lived along the Western Pyrenees, between Spain and France, in one of the most important European glacial refugia during the Last Glacial Maximum. The most striking genetic characteristic is their highest frequency of the RhD blood group negative allele, a variant related to the hemolytic disease of the newborn. Both demographic and adaptive processes have been suggested as possible causes of the high frequency of RhD negative in Basques, but neither hypothesis has been clearly demonstrated. While previous studies on the Rh system in Basques have been mostly focused on serological and genotyping diversity, in this work we analyze genotyping and next generation sequencing data in order to provide a general framework of the genetic scenario of the system in Basques. In particular, we genotyped the most relevant variants of the system (D/d, E/e, and C/c), and sequenced three ~6 kb flanking regions surrounding the Rh genes in Basques and also in other populations for comparison. Our results are in agreement with previous studies, with Basques presenting the highest frequency of the RHD deletion (47.2%). Haplotype analyses of D/d, E/e, and C/c variants confirmed an association between the RhC allele, previously suggested to be under positive selection, and the RhD positive variant in non-sub-Saharan populations, including Basques. We also found extreme differentiation for the C/c variant when comparing sub-Saharan to non-sub-Saharan populations.},

	Abstract = {Background: The subcellular localisation of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) holds valuable clues to their molecular function. However, measuring localisation of newly-discovered lncRNAs involves time-consuming and costly experimental methods. Results: We have created "LncATLAS", a comprehensive resource of lncRNA localisation in human cells based on RNA-sequencing datasets. Altogether, 6768 GENCODE-annotated lncRNAs are represented across various compartments of 15 cell lines. We introduce "Relative concentration index" (RCI) as a useful measure of localisation derived from ensemble RNAseq measurements. LncATLAS is accessible through an intuitive and informative webserver, from which lncRNAs of interest are accessed using identifiers or names. Localisation is presented across cell types and organelles, and may be compared to the distribution of all other genes. Publication-quality figures and raw data tables are automatically generated with each query, and the entire dataset is also available to download. Conclusions: LncATLAS makes lncRNA subcellular localisation data available to the widest possible number of researchers. It is available at lncATLAS.crg.eu.},
